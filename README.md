# Git Practice
I really enjoy this article :x [Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to?source=post_page-----56b0d9de2c43---------------------------------------)

One of my favorite paragraph is:

> The less specific the code is to your application or project, the easier they are to re-use and the less likely to change or be deleted. Library code like logging, or third party APIs, file handles, or processes. Other good examples of code you’re not going to delete are lists, hash tables, and other collections. Not because they often have very simple interfaces, but because they don’t grow in scope over time.
